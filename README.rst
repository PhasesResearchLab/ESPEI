ESPEI, or Extensible Self-optimizing Phase Equilibria Infrastructure, is a tool for automated thermodynamic database development within the CALPHAD method.

The ESPEI package is based on a fork of `pycalphad-fitting`_ and uses `pycalphad`_ for calculating Gibbs free energies of thermodynamic models.
The implementation for ESPEI involves first fitting single-phase data by calculating parameters in thermodynamic models that are linearly described by the single-phase input data.
Then Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to optimize the candidate models from the single-phase fitting to multi-phase zero-phase fraction data.
Single-phase and multi-phase fitting methods are described in Chapter 3 of `Richard Otis's thesis`_.

The benefit of this approach is the automated, simultaneous fitting for many parameters that yields uncertainty quantification, as shown in Otis and Liu High-Throughput Thermodynamic Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification for ICME. `Jom 69, (2017)`_.

The name and idea of ESPEI are originally based off of Shang, Wang, and Liu, ESPEI: Extensible, Self-optimizing Phase Equilibrium Infrastructure for Magnesium Alloys Magnes. Technol. 2010 617â€“622 (2010).

Usage
=====

ESPEI has two different fitting modes: single-phase and multi-phase fitting. Currently which of them is performed depends on the input data (more control coming soon).

A better format for storing thermodynamic data is under development, but there are examples of the `current datasets format`_

To define the sublattice models you must create a JSON file as well. Again, this is under development, but here is a working example of `sublattice fit settings`_.

If you have ESPEI installed you can run it by running the command

.. code-block:: bash

    espei --datasets=my-dataset-folder --fit-settings=my-input.json

If you have a database already and just want to do a multi-phase fitting, you can specify a starting TDB file with

.. code-block:: bash

    espei --datasets=my-dataset-folder --fit-settings=my-input.json --input-tdb=my-starting-database.tdb
