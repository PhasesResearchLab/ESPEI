   \part{Introduction}

ESPEI, or Extensible Self-optimizing Phase Equilibria Infrastructure, is a tool for creating Calphad databases and evaluating the uncertainty of Calphad models.
The purpose of ESPEI is to be both a user tool for fitting state-of-the-art Calphad-type models and to be a research platform for developing methods for fitting and uncertainty quantification.
ESPEI uses `pycalphad`_ for the thermodynamic backend and supports fitting adjustable parameters for any pycalphad model.

ESPEI is developed in the open on `GitHub <https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/ESPEI>`_.
The project is led by Brandon Bocklund, who is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
Brandon developed ESPEI while completing his Ph.D. under Zi-Kui Liu at The Pennsylvania State University.
See the project's `History`_ for more details.

What does ESPEI do?
-------------------

Parameter generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ESPEI can be used to generate model parameters for Calphad models of the Gibbs energy that follow the temperature-dependent power series expansion of the Gibbs energy within the compound energy formalism (CEF) for endmembers and for binary and ternary Redlich-Kister interaction parameters with Muggianu extrapolation.
This parameter generation step augments the Calphad modeler by providing tools for data-driven model selection, rather than relying on a modeler's intuition alone.
Model generation is based on a linear regression of enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity data (see :ref:`non-equilibrium thermochemical data <non_equilibrium_thermochemical_data>`), using the corrected Akiake Information Criterion (AICc) to prevent overfitting.

Optimization and uncertainty quantification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ESPEI can optimize and quantify the uncertainty of Calphad model parameters to thermochemical and :ref:`phase boundary data <phase_boundary_data>`.
Optimization and uncertainty quantification is performed using a Bayesian ensemble Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method.
Any Calphad database can be used, including databases generated by ESPEI or starting from an existing Calphad database.

ESPEI supports all models supported by pycalphad.
User-developed models that are compatible with pycalphad can be used without making any modifications to ESPEI's code.
Performing Bayesian parameter estimation for arbitrary multicomponent thermodynamic data is supported.

History
-------

The name ESPEI and early concept were developed by [Shang2010]_ under the supervision of Zi-Kui Liu.
After developing `pycalphad`_, Richard Otis and Zi-Kui Liu reimagined the concept and wrote
`pycalphad-fitting`_ (used in [Otis2016]_ and [Otis2017]_), which formed the nucleus for the present version of ESPEI ([Bocklund2019]_).

Details on the implementation of ESPEI can be found in the following publications:

- B\. Bocklund *et al.*, MRS Communications 9(2) (2019) 1–10. doi:`10.1557/mrc.2019.59 <https://doi.org/10.1557/mrc.2019.59>`_.
- B\. Bocklund, Ph.D. Dissertation (Chapter 3), The Pennsylvania State University (2021), https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/21192bjb54

We are thankful for the financial support provided to Brandon during his Ph.D. by the Computational Materials Education and Training (CoMET) NSF Research Traineeship (grant number DGE-1449785)
and from a NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship (NSTRF, grant number 80NSSC18K1168).
