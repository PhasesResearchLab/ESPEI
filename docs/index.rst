ESPEI
=====

ESPEI, or Extensible Self-optimizing Phase Equilibria Infrastructure, is a tool for automated thermodynamic database development within the CALPHAD method.

The ESPEI package is based on a fork of `pycalphad-fitting`_ and uses `pycalphad`_ for calculating Gibbs free energies of thermodynamic models.
The implementation for ESPEI involves first fitting single-phase data by calculating parameters in thermodynamic models that are linearly described by the single-phase input data.
Then Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used to optimize the candidate models from the single-phase fitting to multi-phase zero-phase fraction data.
Single-phase and multi-phase fitting methods are described in Chapter 3 of `Richard Otis's thesis`_.

The benefit of this approach is the automated, simultaneous fitting for many parameters that yields uncertainty quantification, as shown in Otis and Liu High-Throughput Thermodynamic Modeling and Uncertainty Quantification for ICME. `Jom 69, (2017)`_.

The name and idea of ESPEI are originally based off of Shang, Wang, and Liu, ESPEI: Extensible, Self-optimizing Phase Equilibrium Infrastructure for Magnesium Alloys `Magnes. Technol. 2010 617-622 (2010)`_.

Installation
============


Anaconda (recommended)
----------------------

ESPEI does not require any special compiler, but several dependencies do.
Therefore it is suggested to install ESPEI from conda-forge.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c pycalphad -c msys2 -c conda-forge --yes espei

After installation, you must turn off dask's work stealing.
Change the work stealing setting to ``work-stealing: False`` in ``~/.dask/config.yaml``.
See the `dask-distributed documentation <https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html>`_ for more.

PyPI
----

Before you install ESPEI via PyPI, be aware that pycalphad and
emcee must be compiled and pycalphad requires an external
dependency of `Ipopt <https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install espei

After installation, you must turn off dask's work stealing.
Change the work stealing setting to ``work-stealing: False`` in ``~/.dask/config.yaml``.
See the `dask-distributed documentation <https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html>`_ for more.

Development versions
--------------------

You may install ESPEI however you like, but here we suggest using
Anaconda to download all of the required dependencies. This
method installs ESPEI with Anaconda, removes specifically the
ESPEI package, and replaces it with the package from GitHub.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/phasesresearchlab/espei.git
    cd espei
    conda install espei
    conda remove --force espei
    pip install -e .

Upgrading ESPEI later requires you to run ``git pull`` in this directory.

After installation, you must turn off dask's work stealing.
Change the work stealing setting to ``work-stealing: False`` in ``~/.dask/config.yaml``.
See the `dask-distributed documentation <https://distributed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html>`_ for more.


Usage
=====

ESPEI has two different fitting modes: single-phase and multi-phase fitting.
You can run either of these modes or both of them sequentially.

To run either of the modes, you need to have a phase models file that describes the phases in the system using the standard CALPHAD approach within the compound energy formalism.
You also need to describe the data that ESPEI should fit to.
You will need single-phase and multi-phase data for a full run.
Fit settings and all datasets are stored as JSON files and described in detail at the :ref:`Input data` page.
All of your input datasets should be validated by running ``espei --check-datasets my-input-datasets``, where ``my-input-datasets`` is a folder of all your JSON files.

The main output result is going to be a database (defaults to ``out.tdb``), an array of the steps in the MCMC chain (defaults to ``chain.npy``), and the an array of the log-probabilities for each iteration and chain (defaults to ``lnprob.npy``).

Single-phase only
-----------------

If you have only heat capacity, entropy and enthalpy data and mixing data (e.g. from first-principles),
you may want to see the starting point for your MCMC calculation.

Create an input file called ``espei-in.yaml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    system:
      phase_models: my-phases.json
      datasets: my-input-datasets
    generate_parameters:
      excess_model: linear
      ref_state: SGTE91

Then ESPEI can be run by running

.. code-block:: bash

    espei --input espei-in.yaml


Multi-phase only
----------------

If you have a database already and just want to do a multi-phase fitting, you can specify a starting TDB file (named ``my-tdb.tdb``) with

.. code-block:: YAML

    system:
      phase_models: my-phases.json
      datasets: my-input-data
    mcmc:
      mcmc_steps: 1000
      input_db: my-tdb.tdb                

The TDB file you input must have all of the degrees of freedom you want as FUNCTIONs with names beginning with ``VV``.

Restart from previous run-phase only
------------------------------------

If you've run an MCMC fitting already in ESPEI and have a chain file called ``my-previous-chain.npy`` , then you can resume the calculation with the following input file

.. code-block:: yaml

    system:
      phase_models: my-phases.json
      datasets: my-input-data
    mcmc:
      mcmc_steps: 1000
      input_db: my-tdb.tdb
      restart_chain: my-previous-chain.npy


Full run
--------

A minimal full run of ESPEI with single phase fitting and MCMC fitting is done by the following

.. code-block:: yaml

    system:
      phase_models: my-phases.json
      datasets: my-input-data
    generate_parameters:
      excess_model: linear
      ref_state: SGTE91
    mcmc:
      mcmc_steps: 1000


Input Customization
-------------------

ESPEI lets you control many aspects of your calculations with the input files shown above.
See :ref:`Writing input files` for a full description of all possible inputs.


FAQ
---

Q: There is an error in my JSON files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: Common mistakes are using single quotes instead of the double quotes required by JSON files.
Another common source of errors is misaligned open/closing brackets.

Many mistakes are found with ESPEI's ``check-datasets`` utility.
Run ``espei check-datasets my-input-datasets`` on your directory ``my-input-datasets``. 

Q: How do I analyze my results?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: By default, ESPEI will create ``chain.npy`` and ``lnprob.npy`` for the MCMC chain at the end of your run and according to the save interval (defaults to every 20 iterations).
These are created from arrays via ``numpy.save()`` and can thus be loaded with ``numpy.load()``.
Note that the arrays are preallocated with zeros.
These filenames and settings can be changed using in the input file.
You can then use these chains and corresponding log-probabilities to make corner plots, calculate autocorrelations, find optimal parameters for databases, etc..
Finally, you can use py:mod:`espei.plot` functions such as ``multiplot`` to plot phase diagrams with your input equilibria data and ``plot_parameters`` to compare single-phase data (e.g. formation and mixing data) with the properties calculated with your database.

Q: Can I run ESPEI on a supercomputer supporting MPI?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A: Yes! ESPEI has MPI support. See the :ref:`MPI` page for more details.
