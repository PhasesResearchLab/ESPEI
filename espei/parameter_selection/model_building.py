def make_successive(xs):
    """
    Return a list of successive combinations

    Parameters
    ----------
    xs : list
        List of elements, e.g. [X, Y, Z]

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of combinations where each combination include all the preceding elements

    Examples
    --------

def build_feature_sets(temperature_features, interaction_features):
    """
    Return a list of broadcasted features

    Parameters
    ----------
    temperature_features : list
        List of temperature features that will become a successive_list, such as [TlogT, T-1, T2]
    interaction_features : list
        List of interaction features that will become a successive_list, such as [YS, YS*Z, YS*Z**2]

    Returns
    -------
    list

    Notes
    -----
    This allows two sets of features, e.g. [TlogT, T-1, T2] and [YS, YS*Z, YS*Z**2]
    and generates a list of feature sets where the temperatures and interactions
    are broadcasted successively.

    Generates candidate feature sets like:
    L0: A + BT,  L1: A
    L0: A     ,  L1: A + BT

    but **not** lists that are not successive:
    L0: A + BT,  L1: Nothing, L2: A
    L0: Nothing, L1: A + BT

    There's still some debate whether it makes sense from an information theory
    perspective to add a L1 B term without an L0 B term. However this might be
    more representative of how people usually model thermodynamics.

    Does not distribute multiplication/sums or make assumptions about the elements
    of the feature lists. They can be strings, ints, objects, tuples, etc..

    The number of features (related to the complexity) is a geometric series.
    For :math:`N` temperature features and :math:`M` interaction features, the total
    number of feature sets should be :math:`N(1-N^M)/(1-N)`. If :math:`N=1`, then there
    are :math:`M` total feature sets.

def build_candidate_models(configuration, features):
    """
    Return a dictionary of features and candidate models

    Parameters
    ----------
    configuration : tuple
        Configuration tuple, e.g. (('A', 'B', 'C'), 'A')
    features : dict
        Dictionary of {str: list} of generic features for a model, not
        considering the configuration. For example:
        {'CPM_FORM': [sympy.S.One, v.T, v.T**2, v.T**3]}

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary of {feature: [candidate_models])

    Notes
    -----
    Currently only works for binary and ternary interactions.

    Candidate models match the following spec:
    1. Candidates with multiple features specified will have
    2. orders of parameters (L0, L0 and L1, ...) have the same number of temperatures

    Note that high orders of parameters with multiple temperatures are not
    required to contain all the temperatures of the low order parameters. For
    example, the following parameters can be generated
    L0: A
    L1: A + BT
