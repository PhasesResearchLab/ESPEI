What's New

0.6.1 (2018-08-28)
==================

This a major release with several important features and bug fixes

* Enable use of ridge regression alpha for parameter selection via the ``parameter_generation.ridge_alpha`` input parameter.
* Add ternary parameter selection. Works by default, just add data.
* Set memory limit to zero to avoid dask killing workers near the dask memory limits.
* Remove ideal mixing from plotting models so that ``plot_parameters`` gives the correct entropy values.
* Add `recipes documentation <https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/ESPEI/blob/master/docs/recipes.rst>` that contains some Python code for common utility operations.
* Add documentation for running custom distributed schedulers in ESPEI


0.6 (2018-07-02)
================

This is a update including *breaking changes to the input files* and several minor improvements.

* Update input file schema and Python API to be more consistent so that the ``trace`` always refers to the collection of chains and ``chain`` refers to individual chains. Additionally removed some redundancy in the parameters nested under the ``mcmc`` heading, e.g. ``mcmc_steps`` is now ``iterations`` and ``mcmc_save_interval`` is now ``save_interval`` in the input file and Python API. See `Writing Input <http://espei.org/en/latest/writing_input.html>`_ documentation for all of the updates.
* The default save interval is now 1, which is more reasonable for most MCMC systems with significant numbers of phase equilibria.
* Bug fixes for plotting and some better plotting defaults for plotting input data
* Dataset parsing and cleaning improvements.
* Documentation improvements (see the `PDF <http://readthedocs.org/projects/espei/downloads/pdf/latest/>`_!)

0.5.2 (2018-04-28)
==================

This is a major bugfix release for MCMC multi-phase fitting runs for single phase data.

* Fixed a major issue where single phase thermochemical data was always compared to Gibbs energy, giving incorrect errors in MCMC runs.
* Single phase errors in ESPEI incorrectly compared values with ideal mixing contributions to data, which is excess only.
* Fixed a bug where single phase thermochemical data with that are dependent on composition and pressure and/or temperature were not fit correctly.
* Added utilities for analyzing ESPEI results and add them to the Cu-Mg example docs.

0.5.1 (2018-04-17)
==================

This is a minor bugfix release.

* Parameter generation for phases with vacancies would produce incorrect parameters because the vacancy site fractions were not being correctly removed from the contributions due to their treatment as ``Species`` objects in ``pycalphad >=0.7``.

0.5 (2018-04-03)
================

* Parameter selection now uses the corrected AIC, which further prevents overparameterization where there is sparse training data.
* Activity and single phase thermochemical data can now be included in MCMC fitting runs. Including single phase data can help anchor metastable phases to DFT data when they are not on the stable phase diagram. See the `Gathering input data <http://espei.org/en/latest/input_data.html>`_ documentation for information on how to input activity data.
* Dataset checking has been improved. Now there are checks to make sure sublattice interactions are properly sorted and mole fractions sum to less than 1.0 in ZPF data.
* Support for fitting phases with arbitrary pycalphad Models in MCMC, including (charged and neutral) species and ionic liquids. There are several consequences of this:

  - ESPEI requires support on ``pycalphad >=0.7``
  - ESPEI now uses pycalphad ``Model`` objects directly. Using the JIT compiled Models has shown up to a *50% performance improvement* in MCMC runs.
  - Using JIT compiled ``Model`` objects required the use of ``cloudpickle`` everywhere. Due to challenges in overriding ``pickle`` for upstream packages, we now rely solely on ``dask`` for scheduler tasks, including ``mpi`` via ``dask-mpi``. Note that users must turn off ``work-stealing`` in their ``~/.dask/config.yaml`` file.

* [Developers] Each method for calculating error in MCMC has been moved into a module for that method in an ``error_functions`` subpackage. One top level function from each module should be imported into the ``mcmc.py`` and used in ``lnprob``. Developers should then just customize ``lnprob``.
* [Developers] Significant internal docs improvements: all non-trivial functions have complete docstrings.

0.4.1 (2018-02-05)
==================

* Enable plotting of isothermal sections with data using ``dataplot`` (and ``multiplot``, etc.)
* Tielines are now plotted in ``dataplot`` for isothermal sections and T-x phase diagrams
* Add a useful ``ravel_conditions`` method to unpack conditions from datasets

0.4 (2017-12-29)
================

* MCMC is now deterministic by default (can be toggled off with the ``mcmc.deterministic`` setting).
* Added support for having no scheduler (running with no parallelism) with the ``mcmc.scheduler`` option set to ``None``. This may be useful for debugging.
* Logging improvements

  - Extraneous warnings that may be confusing for users and dirty the log are silenced.
  - A warning is added for when there are no datasets found.
  - Fixed a bug where logging was silenced with the dask scheduler

* Add ``optimal_parameters`` utility function as a helper to get optimal parameter sets for analysis
* Several improvements to plotting

  - Users can now plot phase diagram data alone with ``dataplot``, useful for checking datasets visually. This changes the API for ``dataplot`` to no longer infer the conditions from an equilibrium ``Dataset`` (from pycalphad). That functionality is preserved in ``eqdataplot``.
  - Experimental data points are now plotted with unique symbols depending on the reference key in the dataset. This is for both phase diagram and single phase parameter plots.
  - Options to control plotting parameters (e.g. symbol size) and take user supplied Axes and Figures in the plotting functions. The symbol size is now smaller by default.

* Documentation improvements for API and separation of theory from the Cu-Mg example
* Fixes a bug where elements with single character names would not find the correct reference state (which are typically named GHSERCC for the example of C).
* [Developer] All MCMC code is moved from the ``paramselect`` module to the ``mcmc`` module to separate these tasks
* [Developer] Support for arbitrary user reference states (so long as the reference state is in the ``refdata`` module and follows the same format as SGTE91)

0.2 (2017-08-15)
==================

* New ``multiplot`` interface for convenient plotting of phase diagrams + data. ``dataplot`` function underlies key data plotting features and can be used with ``eqplot``. See their API docs for examples. Will break existing code using multiplot.
* MPI support for local/HPC runs. Only single node runs are explicitly supported currently. Use ``--scheduler='MPIPool'`` command line option. Requires ``mpi4py``.
* Default debug reporting of acceptance ratios
