* Support internal API changes for pycalphad 0.8.5 (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`183`)
* Fix a regression for ZPF error calculations introduced in :issue:`181` where prescribed phase compositions of stoichiometric phases that used to work no longer work because the phase composition of a stoichiometric phase may be unsatisfiable (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`185`).
* Fix a bug in ZPF error calculations where stoichiometric phases could give incorrect energies for exact equilibrium when prescribed mass balance conditions could not be satisfied. The fix now computes the driving force exactly in all cases for stoichiometric compounds. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`185`)

0.8.2 (2021-05-05)
==================

Improvements
------------
* Fix weighting in model selection (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`176`)

Deprecations
------------
* ``plot_parameters`` is deprecated in favor of ``plot_interaction`` and ``plot_endmember`` (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`177`)

0.8.1 (2021-04-22)
==================

This is a minor release that fixes a performance regression and retires unused
utility code.

* Fixes a performance regression in ``_sample_solution_constitution`` that could cause getting ZPF data for MCMC to be extremely slow. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`174`)
* The ``flexible_open_string`` and ``add_bibtex_to_bib_database`` utilities were removed. Both were unusued in ESPEI. ESPEI no longer depends on ``bibtexparser``. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`171`)

0.8 (2021-04-19)
================

This is a major release with bug fixes and a backward compatible public API,
but breaking changes in the behavior of parameter selection and MCMC
parameter estimation. Some internal functions were deprecated.

Improvements
------------
* Revamped internal logging. For users, ESPEI now has namespaced logging and filters out all non-ESPEI logs (e.g. dask and matplotlib). This change also fixed a bug where changing the verbosity in Jupyter was not taking effect. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`165`)
* Fixed a bug where scalar weights of non-equilibrium thermochemical datasets were not being broadcasted correctly and raised errors. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`154`)
* Fixed a bug where non-equilibrium thermochemical datasets using broadcasted temperatures and compositions were broadcasted against the values incorrectly. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`154`)
* Allow disabling datasets semantically using ``disabled: true`` in JSON datasets. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`153`)
* Users can now pass custom SER reference data to override SER phases, mass, H298, and S298 for existing elements or new elements. Includes better warnings for common errors when the SER data is incompatible with the phases being fit. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`158`)
* Fixed a bug in computing activity error in MCMC where species were not correctly generated from the pure comopnents. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`152`)

Breaking changes
----------------
* Driving forces in ZPF error are now computed from local minimum solutions rather than global minimum solutions. This change significantly improves the convergence for any phases with stable or metastable miscibility gaps. It also prevents users from prescribing phase composition conditions that cannot be satisfied. See the linked GitHub issue for a detailed description of the rationale and implementation of this change. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`151`)
* Removed automatically added ideal exclusions, which was deprecated in ESPEI 0.7. Non-equilibrium thermochemical data should use the ``excluded_model_contributions`` key to exclude ``idmix``, ``mag`` or other model contributions. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`168`)
* Remove deprecated ``mcmc.py`` (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`164`)

Deprecations
------------
* Setting ``mcmc.scheduler`` to the string ``"None"`` to get a serial scheduler is deprecated. Users should use ``null`` in YAML/JSON or ``None`` in Python.
* Deprecated ``multiplot`` and ``eqdataplot`` in favor of having users compose ``binplot`` and ``dataplot``. pycalphad's ``binplot`` is much faster than ``multiplot``. The extra functional call added is worth removing the maintenance burden and allows users to understand more explictly the difference between plotting data and plotting the calculated phase diagram. The documentation was updated to reflect this change and no longer uses ``multiplot``. (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`162`)


0.7.12 (2021-03-16)
===================

This is a minor bugfix release that updates the SGTE reference state data for
carbon and more strictly specifies dependences. No changes to the code were
made since 0.7.11.


0.7.11 (2021-03-12)
===================

This is a minor bugfix release with backwards compatible changes.

* Fix numpy v1.20 deprecations (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`147`)
* Add dataplot tie-line flag (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`145`)
* Add ``corner`` package to dependencies so the recipes now work without installing extra packages


0.7.10 (2020-11-14)
===================

This is a minor bugfix release that addresses a potential inconsistency with hyphen/underscore usage in dask configuration files (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`136`).


0.7.9 (2020-11-12)
==================

This is a minor maintenance release that automatically disables work stealing (users are no longer required to configure this themselves) (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`134`).


0.7.8 (2020-11-10)
==================

This is a bug fix release with backwards compatible changes.

* Fix a bug triggered by pycalphad 0.8.4 where the new parameter extraction behavior could break the MCMC sampler (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`132`)
* Fix a bug where some feature matrices had incorrect shape, stemming from using SymPy.Matrix to symbolically manipulate the data (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`130`)
* Migrate to tinydb v4+ (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`126`)

0.7.7 (2020-04-11)
==================

This is a minor feature and bug fix release with backwards compatible changes.

* Preliminary support for thermochemical error for arbitrary properties (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`124`)
* Update the preferred method for disabling tracefile, probfile, logfile, and no scheduler in YAML to use ``null`` instead of ``"None"`` (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`125`)
* Fix a bug in ``truncate_arrays`` and ``optimal_parameters`` to allow some zeros (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`122`)
* Enable custom unary reference states for parameter  generation with `entry_points` plugin system (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`121`)

0.7.6 (2020-03-27)
==================

This is a minor bug fix release.

* Fixes a bug introduced in 0.7.5 for calculating likelihood for phase boundary data under equilibrium failures (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`120`)
* Since Python 2 was dropped, `six` has been removed as a dependency (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`119`)

0.7.5 (2020-03-09)
==================

This release includes performance optimizations, bug fixes and new features for MCMC simulations.

* This version of ESPEI now requires pycalphad 0.8.2 or later for the features below.
* Fitting subsystems of a large database is explicitly supported and tested for all implemented MCMC data types. Fixes a bug in ZPF error and activity error where having phases in the database that are inactive in the subsystem would raise errors (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`118`).
* Computing thermochemical error and phase boundary (ZPF) error are now optimized to reduce overhead time in dependencies (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`117`)
* A new feature for calculating approximate driving force for phase boundary data is implemented, which can give performance improvements of 3x-10x, depending on the system (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`115`)

0.7.4 (2019-12-09)
==================

This release includes small fixes for parameter generation.

* Excluded model contributions are fixed for models with different sublattice site ratios and for data that are not endmembers (`@bocklund`_ - :issue:`113`)

0.7.3 (2019-12-02)
==================

This change includes several new features and performance improvements.

* Drop Python 2 support (Python 2 is no longer supported on January 1, 2020).
* Update dask and distributed support to versions >=2. (`@bocklund`_)
* Users can tweak the AICc penalty factor for each phase to nudge parameter selection towards adding more or fewer parameters based on user modeling intuition. (`@bocklund`_)
* Allow for tracefile and probfile to be set to None. (`@jwsiegel2510`_)
* Weighting individual datasets in single phase fitting is now implemented via scikit-learn.  (`@bocklund`_)
* Performance improvements by reducing overhead. (`@bocklund`_)
* Increased solver accuracy by using pycalphad's exact Hessian solver. (`@bocklund`_)
* Support writing SER reference state information to the `ELEMENT` keyword in TDBs based on the SGTE unary 5 database.  (`@bocklund`_)
* MCMC now calculates the likelihood of the initial parameter set so the starting point can be reasonably compared.  (`@bocklund`_)
* Fixed a bug where mis-aligned configurations and site occupancies in single phase datasets passed the dataset checker  (`@bocklund`_)

0.7.2 (2019-06-12)
==================

This is a small bugfix release that fixes the inability to provide the EmceeOptimizer a ``restart_trace``.


0.7.1 (2019-06-03)
==================

This is a significant update reflecting many internal improvements, new features, and bug fixes. Users using the YAML input or the ``run_espei`` Python API should see entirely backwards compatible changes with ESPEI 0.6.2.

pycalphad 0.8, which introduced many `key features <https://pycalphad.org/docs/latest/CHANGES.html>`_ for these changes is now required.
This should almost completely eliminate the time to build phases due to the symengine backend (phases will likely build in less time than to call the MCMC objective function).
Users can expect a slight performance improvement for MCMC fitting.

Improvements
------------
* Priors can now be specified and are documented online.
* Weights for different datasets are added and are supported by a ``"weight"`` key at the top level of any dataset.
* Weights for different types of data are added. These are controlled via the input YAML and are documented there.
* A new internal API is introduced for generic fitting of parameters to datasets in the ``OptimizerBase`` class. The MCMC optimizer in emcee was migrated to this API (the ``mcmc_fit`` function is now deprecated, but still works until the next major version of ESPEI). A simple SciPy-based optimizer was implemented using this API.
* Parameter selection can now be passed initial databases with parameters (e.g. for adding magnetic or other parameters manually).
* pycalphad's reference state support can now be used to properly reference out different types of model contributions (ideal mixing, magnetic, etc.). This is especially useful for DFT thermochemical data which does not include model contributions from ideal mixing or magnetic heat capacity. Useful for experimental data which does include ideal mixing (previously ESPEI assumed all data
* Datasets and input YAML files now have a tag system where tags that are specified in the input YAML can override any keys/values in the JSON datasets at runtime. This is useful for tagging data with different weights/model contribution exclusions (e.g. DFT tags may get lower weights and can be set to exclude model contributions). If no tags are applied, removing ideal mixing from all thermochemical data is applied automatically for backwards compatibility. This backwards compatibility feature will be removed in the next major version of ESPEI (all model contributions will be included by default and exclusions must be specified manually).

Bug fixes
---------
* Bug fixed where asymmetric ternary parameters were not properly replaced in SymPy
* Fixed error where ZPF error was considering the chemical potentials of stoichiometric phases in the target hyperplane (they are meaningless)
* Report the actual file paths when dask's work-stealing is set to false.
* Errors in the ZPF error function are no longer swallowed with -np.inf error. Any errors should be reported as bugs.
* Fix bug where subsets of symbols to fit are not built properly for thermochemical data

Other
-----
* Documentation recipe added for `plot_parameters`
* [Developer] ZPF and thermochemical datasets now have an function to get all the data up front in a dictionary that can be used in the functions for separation of concerns and calculation efficiency by not recalculating the same thing every iteration.
* [Developer] a function to generate the a context dict to pass to lnprob now exists. It gets the datasets automatically using the above.
* [Developer] transition to pycalphad's new build_callables function, taking care of the ``v.N`` state variable.
* [Developer] Load all YAML safely, silencing warnings.

0.6.2 (2018-11-27)
==================

This backwards-compatible release includes several bug fixes and improvements.

* Updated branding to include the new ESPEI logo. See the logo in the ``docs/_static`` directory.
* Add support for fitting excess heat capacity.
* Bug fix for broken potassium unary.
* Documentation improvements for recipes
* pycalphad 0.7.1 fixes for dask, sympy, and gmpy2 should mean that ESPEI should not require package upgrade or downgrades. Please report any installations issues in `ESPEI's Gitter Channel <https://gitter.im/PhasesResearchLab/ESPEI>`_.
* [Developers] ESPEI's ``eq_callables_dict`` is now ``pycalphad.codegen.callables.build_callables``.
* [Developers] matplotlib plotting tests are removed because nose is no longer supported.


0.6.1 (2018-08-28)
==================

This a major release with several important features and bug fixes.

* Enable use of ridge regression alpha for parameter selection via the ``parameter_generation.ridge_alpha`` input parameter.
* Add ternary parameter selection. Works by default, just add data.
* Set memory limit to zero to avoid dask killing workers near the dask memory limits.
* Remove ideal mixing from plotting models so that ``plot_parameters`` gives the correct entropy values.
* Add `recipes documentation <https://github.com/PhasesResearchLab/ESPEI/blob/master/docs/recipes.rst>`_ that contains some Python code for common utility operations.
* Add documentation for running custom distributed schedulers in ESPEI


0.6 (2018-07-02)
================

This is a update including *breaking changes to the input files* and several minor improvements.

* Update input file schema and Python API to be more consistent so that the ``trace`` always refers to the collection of chains and ``chain`` refers to individual chains. Additionally removed some redundancy in the parameters nested under the ``mcmc`` heading, e.g. ``mcmc_steps`` is now ``iterations`` and ``mcmc_save_interval`` is now ``save_interval`` in the input file and Python API. See `Writing Input <http://espei.org/en/latest/writing_input.html>`_ documentation for all of the updates.
* The default save interval is now 1, which is more reasonable for most MCMC systems with significant numbers of phase equilibria.
* Bug fixes for plotting and some better plotting defaults for plotting input data
* Dataset parsing and cleaning improvements.
* Documentation improvements (see the `PDF <http://readthedocs.org/projects/espei/downloads/pdf/latest/>`_!)

0.5.2 (2018-04-28)
==================

This is a major bugfix release for MCMC multi-phase fitting runs for single phase data.

* Fixed a major issue where single phase thermochemical data was always compared to Gibbs energy, giving incorrect errors in MCMC runs.
* Single phase errors in ESPEI incorrectly compared values with ideal mixing contributions to data, which is excess only.
* Fixed a bug where single phase thermochemical data with that are dependent on composition and pressure and/or temperature were not fit correctly.
* Added utilities for analyzing ESPEI results and add them to the Cu-Mg example docs.

0.5.1 (2018-04-17)
==================

This is a minor bugfix release.

* Parameter generation for phases with vacancies would produce incorrect parameters because the vacancy site fractions were not being correctly removed from the contributions due to their treatment as ``Species`` objects in ``pycalphad >=0.7``.

0.5 (2018-04-03)
================

* Parameter selection now uses the corrected AIC, which further prevents overparameterization where there is sparse training data.
* Activity and single phase thermochemical data can now be included in MCMC fitting runs. Including single phase data can help anchor metastable phases to DFT data when they are not on the stable phase diagram. See the `Gathering input data <http://espei.org/en/latest/input_data.html>`_ documentation for information on how to input activity data.
* Dataset checking has been improved. Now there are checks to make sure sublattice interactions are properly sorted and mole fractions sum to less than 1.0 in ZPF data.
* Support for fitting phases with arbitrary pycalphad Models in MCMC, including (charged and neutral) species and ionic liquids. There are several consequences of this:

  - ESPEI requires support on ``pycalphad >=0.7``
  - ESPEI now uses pycalphad ``Model`` objects directly. Using the JIT compiled Models has shown up to a *50% performance improvement* in MCMC runs.
  - Using JIT compiled ``Model`` objects required the use of ``cloudpickle`` everywhere. Due to challenges in overriding ``pickle`` for upstream packages, we now rely solely on ``dask`` for scheduler tasks, including ``mpi`` via ``dask-mpi``. Note that users must turn off ``work-stealing`` in their ``~/.dask/config.yaml`` file.

* [Developers] Each method for calculating error in MCMC has been moved into a module for that method in an ``error_functions`` subpackage. One top level function from each module should be imported into the ``mcmc.py`` and used in ``lnprob``. Developers should then just customize ``lnprob``.
* [Developers] Significant internal docs improvements: all non-trivial functions have complete docstrings.

0.4.1 (2018-02-05)
==================

* Enable plotting of isothermal sections with data using ``dataplot`` (and ``multiplot``, etc.)
* Tielines are now plotted in ``dataplot`` for isothermal sections and T-x phase diagrams
* Add a useful ``ravel_conditions`` method to unpack conditions from datasets

0.4 (2017-12-29)
================

* MCMC is now deterministic by default (can be toggled off with the ``mcmc.deterministic`` setting).
* Added support for having no scheduler (running with no parallelism) with the ``mcmc.scheduler`` option set to ``None``. This may be useful for debugging.
* Logging improvements

  - Extraneous warnings that may be confusing for users and dirty the log are silenced.
  - A warning is added for when there are no datasets found.
  - Fixed a bug where logging was silenced with the dask scheduler

* Add ``optimal_parameters`` utility function as a helper to get optimal parameter sets for analysis
* Several improvements to plotting

  - Users can now plot phase diagram data alone with ``dataplot``, useful for checking datasets visually. This changes the API for ``dataplot`` to no longer infer the conditions from an equilibrium ``Dataset`` (from pycalphad). That functionality is preserved in ``eqdataplot``.
  - Experimental data points are now plotted with unique symbols depending on the reference key in the dataset. This is for both phase diagram and single phase parameter plots.
  - Options to control plotting parameters (e.g. symbol size) and take user supplied Axes and Figures in the plotting functions. The symbol size is now smaller by default.

* Documentation improvements for API and separation of theory from the Cu-Mg example
* Fixes a bug where elements with single character names would not find the correct reference state (which are typically named GHSERCC for the example of C).
* [Developer] All MCMC code is moved from the ``paramselect`` module to the ``mcmc`` module to separate these tasks
* [Developer] Support for arbitrary user reference states (so long as the reference state is in the ``refdata`` module and follows the same format as SGTE91)

0.3.1.post2 (2017-10-31)
========================

0.2 (2017-08-15)
==================

* New ``multiplot`` interface for convenient plotting of phase diagrams + data. ``dataplot`` function underlies key data plotting features and can be used with ``eqplot``. See their API docs for examples. Will break existing code using multiplot.
* MPI support for local/HPC runs. Only single node runs are explicitly supported currently. Use ``--scheduler='MPIPool'`` command line option. Requires ``mpi4py``.
* Default debug reporting of acceptance ratios

   - reporting of failed conditions

0.1.5 (2017-08-02)
==================

* Significant error checking of JSON inputs.
* Add new ``--check-datasets`` option to check the datasets at path. It should be run before you run ESPEI fittings. All errors must be resolved before you run.
* Move the espei script module from ``fit.py`` to ``run_espei.py``.
* Better docs building with mocking
